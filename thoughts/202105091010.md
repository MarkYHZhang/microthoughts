Have you ever seen those street sweeper trucks roaming around on the road, maybe even on your neighborhood streets? For some reason, all of the street sweepers that I've ever seen in Canada are not really sweeping the street. They are literal dust sprayer/blowers. Not only do they not clean the street, they blow all of the dirt/sand/dust/or whatever on the street straight into the air. Covering all of its surroundings with what was originally on the floor. I think if the purpose was to evenly spread the dirt on all surfaces possible, then it really has done a great job. How ironic, a street sweeper that was supposed to clean the street, does the exact opposite of polluting the street even more.

Look, I have nothing against street sweepers in general, but unlike in Canada, other countries that I've been to have street sweepers that not only sweeps but also sprays water. This is so that the water can bring down any dirt/dusts back to the ground instead of letting them fly everywhere. Why is this never done here? Until street sweepers starts spraying water to calm the particles down, I'm 100% against their use.
