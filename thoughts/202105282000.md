Man, I'm not used to doing non-SWE work. For all of my previous co-ops I've been a SWE, grinding out code and features like crazy. At least that kind of gave me some sort of a measurable metric, and provided me with a sense of accomplishment. However, now, being a novice pseudo-researcher in ML, making progress is so much harder. Some days I just sit here and change my model's architecture by like a bit, sit and wait like 20 minute for it to train and predict. And repeat. I feel like I must approach this seemingly purely research related task with my engineering hat on. There must be some ways of optimizing and streamlining this process that would accelerate my progress. But anyways, I'm honestly learning so much at this co-op. I'm learning about Sharpe-ratios, Value At Risk, candle stick patterns, and all that financial stuff that I would not have learned from pure SWE positions. Also I'm so glad that this co-op really forced me to create machine learning models and really understand them (at least to the best of my abilities). Rather than being the typical hackathon "machine learning" practitioner, who just know how to use existing models without actually training their own. No flame here, because I have to admit, I was one of them. Anyways, the quest continues, and hope something that is actually somewhat effective can emerge from my experiments.
