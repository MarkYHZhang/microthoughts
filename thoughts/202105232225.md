Just bought an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, honestly pretty cool. Especially given that it is standalone with such a high resolution display and high refresh rate. It really has the best ROI out of all available VR headsets for average consumers. So far, the usage experience has been pretty good, although I can tell where they cut the costs down. Namely, the head strap and the face cushion are exceedingly uncomfortable. However, the actual device itself feels pretty great so far. I guess really the only true complaint is that I'd have to login with a Facebook account, which ain't too big of a deal, but it just felt unnecessary that a game console needs to be connected with my social account. Also heard concerning reports that people's Facebook accounts were getting banned arbitrarily, so I really hope that doesn't happen. I usually never buy any games, but this time I actually spent over 30 CAD on Beat Saber, which I have to admit is a great game and a worthy purchase. This honestly is a beginning to truly standalone and high resolution VR headset. I can imagine in the future where each eye will have an 8k display, and to the point where we can't see any pixels. Then  at that point, do we even need monitors anymore if we can have basically infinite amount of virtual monitors? Very exciting overall, can't wait to try more things out on this headset. So far I highly recommend it :), and if you get it, add me, because I want to play with friends.
