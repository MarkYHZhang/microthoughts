Guess what, just when I thought the meme stock hype has died down, AMC came back right popping off again. Luckily, I still hold 1 share of AMC LOL. It's legit up like 500% my original cost in like a week. Darn, only if I held more :')))))). But who knew, stuff like this really ain't easily predictable. Honestly, if I created a meme stock portfolio where I distribute some investment in to every one of these meme stocks. Then the expected return is probability gonna be pretty darn high, considering how much they can rise (but also dip).
