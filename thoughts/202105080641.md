Responding to a feature request, I've added support for \\(LaTeX\\)
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

Naturally, gotta have code snippet support as well!
```
for file in reversed(os.listdir("thoughts")):
    if file.endswith(".md"):
        with open("thoughts/" + file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            text = f.read()
```
