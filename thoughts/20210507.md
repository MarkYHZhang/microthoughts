Hello world! You may be wondering: "hey Mark you already have a [blog](https://blog.markzhang.io) why do you need another place to write your stuff?" Good question, there are a few reasons:

1. [The blog](https://blog.markzhang.io) is more of a place for elongated posts, that I usually write every 4 months or so.
2. I've always wanted to have a place where I can just record down my random thoughts and then publish it without much polish.
3. Not a big fan of posting this on social media sites as I want a site where I have full control over my content and its interactions with people.
4. Experiement with Cloudflare Pages! This is in fact deployed there, so big kudos to them, it was really easy to set up. This whole [generator repo](https://github.com/MarkYHZhang/microthoughts) took me like 3 hours to setup with direct deployment to [thoughts.markzhang.io](https://thoughts.markzhang.io)
