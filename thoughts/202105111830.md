Tech stocks really ain't doing well... My portfolio is literally at all time lows... I guess I really should've diversified more! But calm down Mark, don't panic sell... I'll try not to look at my portfolio for the next month and just let it be... Hopefully in a month time, it'll be in the positives ðŸ¤ž.
